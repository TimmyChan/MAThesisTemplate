For writing big files, you may separate your files into subfiles. For example, this paragraph is in \texttt{subfile.tex}. I inputted this file into \texttt{content.tex} by using the "standalone" package and the following command where the sentence should be with the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
\input{subfile.tex} 
\end{verbatim}
